Have the final word in a comment thread by marking a chosen comment as the 'top comment'.

== Description ==

This plugin is built for and requires [O2](https://github.com/Automattic/o2) to be installed.

This plugin allows you to mark a selected comment as the one that effectively sums up the conversation from the thread. This is great for disucssions that require a final decision to be made, support threads where one comment has the best solution, and a host of other uses.

Functionality includes:

* Marking a chosen comment as the 'top comment'
* The top comment is displayed at the top of the comment list with a 'view in context' anchor link
* The top comment is also highlighted in context in the thread
* Only one comment can be selected as the top comment
* The top comment flag can be removed
* Only users who are able to edit the post can select a top comment
* Includes basic styling for top comments
* 'Top comment' label can be translated and/or filtered

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

No. In the future it might be updated to  work with other themes, but O2 has such a specific way of handling comments that this won't work elsewhere just yet.
